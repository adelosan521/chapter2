This Github repository contains the scripts used in Chapter 2 of Alejandro De Los Angeles's DPhil thesis. The three bioinformatics tools that were used in the Chapter were DESEQ2, DEXSEQ, and MAJIQ.

The programming code for the computational pipeline used to pre-process raw sequencing data for DESEQ2 is the "DESEQ2_initial_processing" script. The code for running DESEQ2 is contained in the "DESEQ2_analyses_R" script.

The programming code for the computational pipeline used to pre-process raw sequencing data for DEXSEQ is the "DEXSEQ_initial_processing" script. The code for running DEXSEQ is contained in the "DEXSEQ_analyses" script.

Finally, the programming code for running MAJIQ and VOILA is contained in the "majiq" script.

This Github repository contains the scripts used in Chapter 2 of Alejandro De Los Angeles's DPhil thesis. The three bioinformatics tools that were used in the Chapter were DESEQ2, DEXSEQ, and MAJIQ. DESEQ2 is used for gene expression analysis; DEXSEQ is used to assess differential exon usage (DEU); and MAJIQ is used to quantify differential splice junction utilization.

The programming code for the computational pipeline used to pre-process raw sequencing data for DESEQ2 is the "DESEQ2_initial_processing.sh" script. The code for running DESEQ2 is contained in the "DESEQ2_analyses.R" script.

The programming code for the computational pipeline used to pre-process raw sequencing data for DEXSEQ is the "DEXSEQ_initial_processing.sh" script. The code for running DEXSEQ is contained in the "DEXSEQ_analyses.R" script.

Finally, the programming code for running MAJIQ and VOILA is contained in the "majiq.sh" script.
